**This is a library that builds a replica of the command prompt which adds wide variety of options to it than the normal terminal.**

<p>The library is made to bring more flexibility to terminal applications such as games by allowing them to create complex algorithms 
by adding all kinds of events and controls that give you the option to create a player movement, for example.</p>
